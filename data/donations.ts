      "The project objectives include designing and developing a user-friendly and secure crowdfunding application tailored to students' needs. Extensive research will be conducted to explore existing crowdfunding platforms within the education sector, analyze successful campaigns, and identify best practices and success factors. Strategies for effective project promotion, engagement, and communication will be developed to maximize fundraising effectiveness and student-donor interaction. The impact of the crowdfunding application on student project outcomes and the overall educational experience will be evaluated through feedback and assessments from students, donors, and other stakeholders. One crucial thing to note is that Serverless requires several different AWS IAM privileges. S3, CloudFormation, API Gateway, and Lambda to name a few. There are ways to scope the IAM privileges only to meet the necessary requirements which can be found here. I’ve found that while this is the most secure approach to take, it’s certainly not the fastest. I’ll make the recommendation that if this is a personal AWS account, save yourself some time and give your account “AdministratorAccess” privileges from IAM.",
    issue: "Despite the importance of academic projects in the educational journey of students, a significant challenge they face is the limited availability of financial resources to support their projects. Traditional funding options, such as personal savings, part-time jobs, or grants, often fall short in meeting the diverse and ambitious funding needs of students. As a result, many students are unable to fully realize their project ideas or are forced to compromise on their vision due to financial constraints. The absence of a dedicated crowdfunding application for students poses several problems. Firstly, students are limited in their ability to reach potential donors who are specifically interested in supporting educational initiatives. The lack of a centralized platform tailored to students' needs makes it difficult for them to showcase their projects and gain visibility among the right target audience.",
  objective: "Design and develop a user-friendly and secure crowdfunding application tailored to the unique needs of students.The application should provide intuitive features for project creation, donation management, and communication between students and donors. Explore existing crowdfunding platforms within the education sector and analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and success factors. This objective will involve studying successful crowdfunding campaigns for educational projects and identifying best practices and lessons learned. Develop an in-app chat forum to encourage student collaborations and engagements in other students projects."},
